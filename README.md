# Assumptions

1. I haven't implemented any functionality for the share button.  But my assumption is that it would copy the url and possibly show a popover that would allow to share with someone via Facebook, WhatsApp etc..

2. Links in the footer navigate to Avant Arte facebook and twitter pages. 

3. I have made the assumption that for this task marking an item as complete does not need to be saved to any local storage or database.  NOTE: If i were to implement this in a real world app then i would save to a database or localstorage to maintain it's state between browser refreshes and implement user table in the database or maybe something in session on the backend to maintain relationship between user and data in the situation where multiple users were using this application.

## Outstanding Implementations

1. Share button.
2. on Hover and Focus css changes
3. Implement the "SF Pro Rounded".  Had some issues implementing the font


## React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
